# Agents.md

Purpose: define documentation rules for this project.

## Structure
- docs/ROADMAP.md: high-level plan and status
- docs/tasks/NNN-task.md: atomic tasks with scope and done criteria
- docs/references/*.md: stable specs (architecture, api, resources)
- docs/logs/*.md: session notes and decisions by date

## Rules
- Keep documents short and current
- Use ASCII only unless a file already contains non-ASCII
- Update ROADMAP when task status changes
- Each task must define scope and done criteria
- Log decisions in docs/logs
- Avoid implementation details in tasks; link to references

## Task template
- Title
- Goal
- Scope
- Out of scope
- Dependencies
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Done criteria
- Risks
- Notes
